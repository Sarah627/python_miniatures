print("hello,world")
# just the very first code line in python, printing
# hello, world on the console, we'are just using the print function print()
# if we wanna write text so insert this text in a double quotes
# in the parenthesis of the print function, and that's it!

# to interpret the code in the terminal, type python filename.py
